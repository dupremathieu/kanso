# Manual UI testing

The board is a plain ES-module SPA served by `kanso serve`; there is no build
step. Run the automated checks first:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
node tests/imports_ui.mjs
node tests/pairing_ui.mjs
```

## External task imports

Production registers GitHub. `tests/api.rs` exercises project-scoped discovery,
authorization and import using a test-only fixture; provider unit tests use
mocked GitHub responses and subprocesses without live credentials.
`tests/imports_ui.mjs` covers category/filter selection, safe links, in-flight
state, errors, and invalidation without browser dependencies and runs in CI.

For an optional real Chromium check, build the binary and install Playwright
in your external test tooling, then run:

```sh
cargo build --locked
node scripts/test-imports-ui.mjs
# Or set PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE to an installed Playwright index.mjs.
```

This uses disposable local data under `~/.cache/tmp/opencode`, disables the
OpenChamber integration, and intercepts fixture-provider responses only inside
the test browser. No live credential or production provider is required. It
checks production provider registration and mocked preview/confirmation UI on desktop and
mobile, including unsafe text/links, duplicate-safe retry results, filter
invalidation, and provider errors. Set `KANSO_IMPORTS_SCREENSHOTS=dist/review`
to retain desktop/mobile screenshots. The mocked browser flow complements,
but does not replace, the Rust API tests.

`tests/ui.rs` covers the shell, every module, `i18n/en.js`,
`vendor/marked.min.js`, content types and the deep-link fallback.
`tests/sbom.rs` keeps `web/package.json`, `web/package-lock.json` and the
vendored `marked` build in sync with the crate version. Generate the published
SBOMs with `./scripts/sbom.sh` (see the README); the script validates both
documents.

## Start a clean local instance

```sh
rm -rf /tmp/kanso-ui
KANSO_PASSWORD=dev KANSO_DATA_DIR=/tmp/kanso-ui cargo run -- serve
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8087>. Use a current Chromium or Firefox. Keep the
browser DevTools console open and watch for errors during every step.

To restart the server, stop it with Ctrl+C and run the same command again; the
database in `/tmp/kanso-ui` survives, which is useful for the reconnection test.

## 1. Login and session

1. Load the page in a private window. Only the login card appears; no board
   layout flashes before the auth check resolves.
2. Enter a wrong password: an inline error appears.
3. Enter `dev`: the board opens (empty until a project exists).
4. Use the top-bar sign-out control: the login card returns, the event stream
   closes and client state is gone.
5. In DevTools, clear the `kanso_session` cookie and press reload: the login
   card appears instead of a broken board.

## 2. Projects and cards

1. On the empty board choose **Create a project** and fill in key `ALP`, name
   `Alpha`, a description, a colour, and (optionally) the agent fields. Save.
2. Open **Settings → Projects** and confirm the project is listed; edit its
   name and save. Keep `ALP` active for the rest of this run; archiving is
   exercised on a throwaway second project in section 8 (archived keys stay
   taken, so `ALP` cannot be re-created without a fresh data directory).
3. Create three cards with **New card**: one in Backlog, one in To do, one in
   In progress. Give them different priorities and a due date in the past and
   one in the future. Labels are created in the panel flow of section 6.
4. Use a column's **Add a card** footer and press Enter: the card is created in
   that column without opening the full dialog.
5. Copy the URL of an open card (`/p/ALP/task/1`) and hard-reload it. The board
   and the 420 px panel return on the deep link.
6. Enter a made-up project key (`/p/NOPE`) and a made-up card
   (`/p/ALP/task/9999`): both show a friendly not-found page with a link back to
   the board, not a blank page or console crash.

## 3. Drag & drop

1. With a mouse, drag a card within its column: a ghost follows the pointer, a
   dashed placeholder moves between cards, and the drop reorders immediately.
   Reload and confirm the order survived.
2. Drag a card across columns. The source count drops, the target count rises
   immediately (optimistic update), and the panel/column order matches after the
   request completes. If the server rejects the move, a toast appears and the
   board refetches.
3. Start a drag and press Escape: the card returns to its place and no request is
   sent.
4. Drag a card to the far left/right edge of the board: the board auto-scrolls.
5. In DevTools device emulation (touch), a short swipe scrolls the board without
   starting a drag; press and hold a card for about 250 ms, then drag. A plain
   tap opens the card.
6. On every card, open the **⋮ / Move to…** control and move it with the menu.
   This must work without a pointer drag.

## 4. Keyboard-only flow

Focus the page (not an input) and try:

- `n` opens the new-card dialog.
- `/` focuses the search field; `Esc` clears and leaves it.
- `j` / `k` selects the next / previous visible card, scrolls it into view and
  opens its panel.
- `m` opens the **Move to…** menu for the selected card.
- `Esc` closes the panel or an open dialog.
- `?` (Shift+/) opens **Keyboard shortcuts**. The dialog lists `n`, `/`, `j`,
  `k`, `m`, `Esc` and `?`; focus moves into it, `Esc` closes it and focus
  returns to whatever was focused before. Clicking the `?` button in the top
  bar opens the same dialog.
- The page behind the help dialog does not scroll, and the dialog is usable
  with Tab/Shift+Tab alone.

Shortcuts must do nothing while an input, textarea or select has focus, or while
Ctrl, Alt or Cmd is held. Tab through the top bar, columns and panel controls;
every action is reachable and has a visible focus ring.

## 5. Two tabs and live updates

1. Open the board in two tabs.
2. Create a card, move it, comment on it, and toggle a checklist item in tab A.
   Tab B updates without a reload (checklist progress/comment included when its
   panel is open).
3. In tab A, open a card panel. In tab B, archive or restore that card; tab A
   reflects the state change.
4. Stop the server with Ctrl+C. Both tabs show a connection-lost toast; tab B
   keeps working in a degraded read-only-ish state.
5. Start the server again. Within the backoff window both tabs reconnect, show a
   connection-restored toast, and fully refetch the board and any open card.

## 6. Card panel

On one card, verify in order:

1. Description: Markdown renders; **Edit** → change → **Save**; **Cancel**
   restores the old text.
2. Status, priority and due date editors persist after reload. Clearing the due
   date removes the chip.
3. Labels: on a clean database use **New label** first to create `urgent` and
   add it in the same step; remove it, then add it again from the label picker.
   Create a second project, then restrict the label to the first project in
   **Settings → Projects → Labels**. Verify it is absent from the second project's
   card creation and label picker, while existing associations remain visible.
   Switch projects in the card creation form and verify the choices update.
   Remove the last project from the scope, verify existing associations remain,
   then remove one and verify that it cannot be added back until in scope again.
4. Checklist: add two items; toggle one (progress becomes `1/2` and the board
   card shows `1/2`); edit an item's text; move it up/down; remove an item.
5. Comments: add a comment; it appears in the panel and, when the other tab has
   the same card panel open, there too. The board itself does not show comments.
6. Dependencies: add `ALP-2` to `ALP-1`'s **Blocked by** list. `ALP-2` now shows
   **Blocks** on its own panel. While `ALP-2` is not done, `ALP-1`'s card shows a
   lock and claiming it returns a `dependency_unmet` toast. Remove it from
   `ALP-1`'s **Blocked by** list, then add it again and remove it from
   `ALP-2`'s **Blocks** list; both directions have separate code paths.
7. Claim / Release: claim an unclaimed backlog/todo card; it stays in its column
   and shows the claim badge. Release it. Agent claims move to In progress.
8. Archive the card: it leaves the board but the panel stays usable and offers
   **Restore**. Restore it. Delete a throwaway card and confirm the confirmation
   dialog; it disappears everywhere.

## 7. Inbox

1. Create an agent token in **Settings → Tokens** (scope Agent) and copy it.
2. Push a proposal through the API:

   ```sh
   curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8087/api/tasks \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer kanso_REPLACE_ME" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"project_key":"ALP","title":"Proposal from an agent","description":"Details"}'
   ```

3. The Inbox tab badge increments in every open tab. The proposal is newest
   first and does not appear on the board.
4. Accept it into a chosen column (default Backlog): the toast confirms, the
   proposal leaves the inbox and the card appears on the board.
5. Reject another proposal: confirm the dialog, it disappears and stays off the
   board.
6. With an empty inbox, the empty state is shown.

## 8. Global view and settings

1. Create a second project and a few cards. Open **Global**: cards are grouped
   by project, then by the six fixed columns. By default only In progress, In
   review and Blocker are shown; tick **Show all columns** to see everything.
2. Search filters cards by reference, title, label and claim name. The search
   works in both project and global views.
3. **Settings → Projects**: create, edit (`PATCH` persists all agent fields),
   and archive a project. Archived projects are listed separately.
4. **Settings → Tokens**: create a Human and an Agent token; the plaintext is
   shown once and the Copy button works. The list shows scope, creation and
   last-used time. Revoke one and confirm it is marked revoked.
5. Agent identities in the UI would not see project/token/inbox admin controls;
   the API still enforces this, but the browser login is always the human UI
   session. Check with a bearer token only through the API if needed.

## 9. Markdown safety

Put this in a card description (and in a comment), save, then inspect the DOM:

```markdown
<script>window.__xss = 1</script>
<img src=x onerror="window.__xss = 2">
![tracking pixel](https://example.com/pixel.png)
<iframe src="https://example.com"></iframe>
[bad](javascript:alert(1)) [data](data:text/html,<b>x</b>)
**safe** and `code`
[good](https://example.com)
```

Expected: no script runs, `window.__xss` is undefined, the raw HTML tags and
`javascript:` links render as inert text (or lose their link), the Markdown
image becomes its alt text, and the good link opens in a new tab with
`rel="noopener noreferrer"`. No external image or iframe request appears in the
Network panel.

## 10. Responsiveness and themes

1. At 1100 px wide: the panel overlays the board instead of shrinking the
   columns; drag its left edge to resize (320–640 px) and reload to confirm the
   width and collapsed state persist in `localStorage`.
2. At 700 px wide: columns are about 85 vw and the board scrolls horizontally;
   the panel becomes full-width when opened.
3. Toggle the operating system between light and dark themes; both remain
   readable (cards, panel, labels, modals, toasts, due-date colours).
4. Scroll the board horizontally and vertically; the top bar and page stay
   usable, and the board has no double scrollbar surprises.

## 11. Notifications

1. Open **Settings → Export**. The Notifications block shows the current
   permission state. With a fresh browser profile it says **Not requested**;
   no permission prompt appears on page load.
2. Turn the switch on: the browser asks for permission. Grant it; the state
   changes to **Granted**, the bell in the top bar becomes active and the
   **Send a test notification** row appears.
3. Click **Send a test notification**: a notification appears immediately even
   though this tab is visible, and a success toast confirms it.
4. Hide the tab (switch windows) and, from another tab or the API, move a card to
   In review or set `attention`. A single browser notification fires. (The
   `attention` flag is written by the agent adapter in M5; the In review branch
   is the reachable path without it.)
5. Turn the switch off from either the bell or the settings block: both reflect
   the change without a reload, and no notification fires for the next In review
   move.
6. Deny permission in the browser's site settings, then reload: the block shows
   **Blocked** with an explanation, the switch is disabled and no test row is
   shown. Clicking the bell shows a warning instead of a permission loop.
7. In a browser without the Notification API (or after removing it in DevTools),
   the block stays visible, says the API is unsupported and hides the switch
   instead of disappearing silently.

## 12. Export

1. Open **Settings → Export**. The page explains the dump and shows a single
   **Download export** button; it does not fetch or download on load.
2. Create a project, a card with a checklist and a comment, archive one card
   **and** one project, and have an agent token create a proposal. Click
   **Download export**:
   a `kanso-export-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` file downloads and a summary appears
   with the JSON version and project/card/comment counts.
3. Open the file: `version` is `1`, `exported_at` is Unix milliseconds,
   `projects` contains active and archived projects, `tasks` contains active,
   archived and proposed cards with `checklist` and `dependencies`, and
   `comments` reference existing `task_reference` values. Activity is absent.
4. In DevTools, block the API or stop the server and click the button: the
   normal error toast appears. With an expired session the login screen returns
   instead of a blank download tab (the UI fetches and downloads a Blob rather
   than opening `/api/export.json` in a new window).
5. Using an agent token, `curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer kanso_…"
   http://127.0.0.1:8087/api/export.json` returns `403 forbidden`; a human token
   or the cookie session returns the dump with `Content-Type: application/json`,
   `Content-Disposition: attachment; …` and `Cache-Control: no-store`.

## One-time secret handoffs (KANSO-11)

Use disposable test credentials, never a real credential, for these checks.
The full contract and threat model are in `KANSO-11-SPEC.md`.

1. With a linked session on an active in-progress card, run
   `kanso secret request ALP-42 --label "Test API token" --purpose "Test one command"`.
   Only the request ID is output (including with `--json`); the card becomes
   blocked and the browser updates without reloading the entire application.
2. Open the card. The dedicated Secret request section shows the label,
   purpose and expiry separately from ordinary replies. Enter a disposable
   multiline value with leading/trailing whitespace. It is masked by default;
   Reveal/Hide toggles it without changing the value. Do not put it in comments.
3. Refresh or close/reopen the panel before submitting: the value must be gone,
   not restored from drafts or local/session storage. Submit a new test value.
   Submission removes the input and shows ready/delivery status. The value
   must not appear in task detail, comments, activity, notifications, SSE,
   exports, SQLite/WAL/backup files or the OpenChamber conversation.
4. Run `kanso secret exec REQUEST_ID --env TEST_TOKEN -- COMMAND`. Use a command
   that verifies equality without printing the environment. Confirm exact
   whitespace preservation and exit-status propagation, and that a second
   consume fails. No raw secret file is created. The private capability file
   is removed. Child failure/launch failure does not permit another retrieval.
5. Fail the mock OpenChamber send, then submit another test credential. The
   value remains ready, the UI shows failed/unknown, and Retry/Retry anyway
   sends only the same reference message. No deadline is extended. Arbitrary
   upstream error text must never reach the UI, logs or stored delivery error.
6. Test Decline (optional non-secret explanation), Cancel while waiting/ready,
   and a fresh request after a terminal request while still blocked. A new
   ordinary blocker question must prevent that special re-request operation.
7. Change session, move out of blocker, archive, revoke the requesting token,
   expire the request, or restart Kanso. Retrieval must fail and the value must
   disappear. Restart must explicitly explain that a new request is needed.
   No expiry/cancellation notification should wake the session.
8. Check private capability directory/file modes (0700/0600), symlink and
   overwrite rejection, no capability in CLI output/arguments/public metadata,
   safe behavior after lost/malformed create responses, and request/byte caps.

Automated coverage includes memory-unit limits/concurrency, scheduled expiry,
backend authorization/lifecycle/notification/non-persistence tests in `m5`, and
CLI/file/child-execution and UI draft-isolation tests. Interactive checks remain
important for the multiline mask, reveal, navigation and browser storage.

`scripts/test-secret-ui.mjs` also runs these interactions in real headless
Chromium against an isolated local Kanso process and a mock OpenChamber (no
real sessions or credentials). Build with `cargo build --locked` first. With
Playwright installed in your test tooling, run `node scripts/test-secret-ui.mjs`;
`PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` can point to its absolute `index.mjs` if it is installed
outside this repository. Install its Chromium headless shell with
`playwright install chromium --only-shell` using that tooling. Set `TMPDIR` to
your private test cache, and optionally set `KANSO_UI_SCREENSHOT` to a PNG path.
The test checks desktop/mobile masking, draft/storage isolation, live SSE,
submission, reference-only notifications, actual CLI environment injection and
exit status, capability cleanup, decline/cancellation and safe delivery retry.

## 13. Blocked agent dialog

Setup: OpenChamber is enabled, the card has a linked session (dispatch or
**Link an existing session**) and the project has a `repo_path`.

### Happy path

1. As an agent token, run `kanso move ALP-42 blocker --reason "Use main or develop?"`.
   The board card shows one truncated reason line under the title; hovering the
   lock shows the full question. The card stays in Blocker, and (with
   notifications enabled and the tab hidden) one "{ref} needs an answer"
   notification fires.
2. Open the card: an **Agent question** section appears after the summary, with
   the Markdown question, the session status and a reply box. Focus is not taken.
3. Type an answer and press **Send reply**. The reply appears immediately as a
   comment by **You**; the box clears for a follow-up; **Last reply sent …**
   appears. In the agent's OpenChamber session the prompt begins
   `Human reply on ALP-42 — … (reply <comment id>):`, quotes the question and
   ends with the "move the card out of blocker" instruction.
4. The card is still in Blocker, its `session_status` is `running` and
   `attention` is cleared. The agent continues and moves the card out of
   Blocker; the panel's Agent question section disappears and the reply stays in
   the comment thread.

### Failed delivery and retry

1. Make `session.send` answer HTTP 500 (or 2xx with `promptDispatched:false`).
   Send a reply. The reply is recorded, a toast says delivery failed, and the
   panel shows the error with **Retry**; the comment carries a **Not delivered**
   badge whose tooltip is the upstream error. (Stopping OpenChamber entirely is a
   transport error and belongs to the unknown case below.)
2. Restart OpenChamber and press **Retry** in the panel or on the comment. The
   reply becomes **sent**, the badge disappears, and the card's status is only
   `running`/`attention=0`; the column did not change. A retry after a
   successful delivery answers `409 already_sent`.

### Unknown delivery

1. Point the adapter at an unreachable URL or return a malformed 2xx body. Send
   a reply: it is recorded with an **unknown** delivery, and the panel warns that
   the agent may already have the message; the action is **Retry anyway** and
   explicitly mentions a possible duplicate.
2. Retry once the service is reachable: the stored prompt is resent unchanged
   (the reply comment id in the prompt lets the agent deduplicate it).
